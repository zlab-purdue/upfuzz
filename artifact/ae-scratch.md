# Reproducing the Results from Scratch

To streamline the artifact evaluation (AE) process, we provide pre-built instrumented binaries (Step 1) and pre-recorded bug-triggering traces, enabling a push-button evaluation workflow.  
Reviewers could also reproduce results entirely from scratch; however, this requires a substantial amount of computation time.

All experiments were originally conducted in parallel using a large number of servers.

---

## 1. Creating the Instrumented Binary

### 1.1 Source Code Analysis

- Repository: `vasco`: https://github.com/zlab-purdue/vasco
- Identify (1) which objects are serialized to disk and (2) where to monitor them 

### 1.2 Source Code Instrumentation

- Repository: `dinv-monitor`: https://github.com/zlab-purdue/vasco
- Instrument hooks to ssg-runtime (collect feedbacks) based on information from 1.1

### 1.3 data format runtime collection (feedback)

- Repository: `ssg-runtime`: https://github.com/zlab-purdue/ssg-runtime
- Collect data format feedback during test execution and check whether the collected feedback is interesting.

## 2. Fuzz Testing

- Repositories: `upfuzz`

### Reproducing Tables 2 and 3

**Expected time:** approximately **450 machine-days**.

For each version pair, we configure UpFuzz to test under multiple settings and repeat each experiment three times.  
Scripts are provided to automatically check whether a failure is successfully triggered.

### Reproducing Figure 14

**Expected time:** approximately **27 machine-days**.

We configure UpFuzz to run in the state-exploration mode.

### Reproducing Table 4

This experiment follows the same procedure described in `ae.md`.
